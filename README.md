# Portfolio-Website

<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
Website I have created for my portfolio.

<h2>Current Content and Future Plans</h2>
Right now I have included my web projects along with their descriptions, tags, and links.
Furthermore, I have created admin account for myself which allows me to log in and quickly add new projects to my portfolio.

In the next update I will add my computer app projects such as games and AI algorithms.
Soon after that I plan to clean up the code, and then create a home page, and "about me" page.

Once this is complete I will add more screens to each app so that visitors will have a better picture of my projects. Might add in some slideshows or videos to make my portfolio website more interactive.
